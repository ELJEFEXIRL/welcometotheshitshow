<h1>ursla k. le guin - a rant about "technology"</h1>

      <strong>
    <p> Technology is many different things around us everyday. It can be a human interface, it could be your cellphone.
      Technology has the ability to bridge the gap between the real world and the artificial world, think about the metaverse as an example.
      All good things take time and the internet was not built in a day. Each day you should strive to be better than yesteray. As a whole technology
      is always evolving so who says we as a human race cant evolve as well.
      </strong>
      <br></br>
      <strong>
        strive to make each day better than the last
      </strong>
