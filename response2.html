<h1> Laurel Schwulst - My Website is a Shifting House</h1>

      <strong>
    <p>Schwulst's composing is dope. I for one truly partaken in this perusing. I have perused this paper previously, yet its useful contemplating every one of the conceivable outcomes of all the aspects of a website can be. He shares that there are such countless potential outcomes with making website architecture kind of like software architecture- a site can be many things...a room, a rack, a plant, a nursery, a puddle. It's anything the maker might want to make of it. There is such a huge amount to investigate, and this perusing causes me to feel roused to trial and face challenges. Additionally, examining the fate of the web is a big think to think about, kind of like the mulitverse. A site is presently not an intricate business card, yet a space to enrich as you see fit.</p>
