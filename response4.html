<h1>Frank Chimero- the webs grain</h1>

      <strong>
    <p> Frank Chimero brings up an interesting point of view with the theory that technology and the world around us and is easily accesable.
      However he also states that it is not exaclty the most comfortable. Outside of the normal physical difficulties in real life
      in addition to the various mental difficulties as well. You cant forget about the metaverse as well.
      If you put it into perspective, it could have a serious impaced on the human race in less than a decade.
      I for one can definetly see a surge of exponential growth in the potential of this type of digital world.
      Many people do not understand the seam between technology and the world around us, but as a computer science major i have seen
      what it really means ansd it definetly opened my eyes to many new things.
