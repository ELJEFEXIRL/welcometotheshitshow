  <h1> This is a personal project that was a year in the making. I do crossfit gymnastics for fun in my free time and this was my
    blooper video that originally was 100 videos but i had to cut it down for the sake of the space on my google drive...
    <br>
    after 1 year of training my ass off. It might not look like alot but from not being able to do a pull up a year ago
    to hanging upside down is a drastic difference. <br>Not to mention the fact that i learned this all by myself with nobody to help me.
    <br>The process was long and i am still not done, i remind myself everyday practice makes progress not perfection :)</h1>
